		This is a libpcap-based program with two runtime modes:
		1)It can sniff packets and spools them straight to disk 
		and can daemonize itself for background packet logging.
		2)It can sniff packets and rewrite them to a second 
		interface, acting as a soft tap.
		These two runtime modes are mutually exclusive.
