# Config file for /etc/init.d/snort.0
#
# The snort ebuild now supports running multipule instances of Snort and
# includes optional CPU pinning of individual Snort instances. To support
# multipule instances of Snort, the init.d scripts and this conf.d file 
# have been changed to use a design simular to that used by baselayout
# to support starting multipule network interface cards using a single
# conf.d file.
#
# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# The default snort.conf now includes the following entries:
#
# config daq:
# config daq_dir:
# config daq_mode:
# config logdir:
#
# If you descide to create Snort instance manually and not use 'emerge --config snort'
# you must configure these settings for the init.d scripts to work. These are set
# correctly for you if you use 'emerge --config snort' to create new instances of Snort.
#
# Optionally, you may also want to cofigure the following if you need these settings as well:
#
# config daq_var: 
# config set_gid: 
# config set_uid: 
# config snaplen:
# config bpf_file:
#
# These settings are no longer defined in this conf.d file.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
#
# config_snort<instance #>=( "<instance name>" "<snort config>" "<capture interface>" "<CPU>" )
#
# <instance #>
# The new snort init.d script names have the format /etc/init.d/snort.<instance #>. Each init.d
# script must have a corresponding config_snort<instance #> entry in this conf.d file.
# To create new init.d scripts to support additional Snort, create a symlink to the existing 
# snort.0 init.d scripts installed by the Snort ebuild.
#
# cd /etc/init.d
# ln -s snort.0 snort.1
#
# <instance name>
# This can be any string of alpha/numeric characters and must match an existing instance directory
# located in /etc/snort/.
#
# <snort config>
# The name of the configuration file for this instance of Snort. The default is snort.conf.
#
# <capture interface>
# The name of the interface(s) Snort is listening on. For passive deployments, a single interface
# should be used.
#
# Example: "eth1"
#
# For inline deployments, two interfaces seperated by a colon should be used.
#
# Example: "eth1:eth2"
#
# <CPU>
# The processor to pin this instance of Snort to. The first processor on a system is always "0".
# Use 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' to see a list of available processors for your system. CPU pinning is
# optional. If you do not want to pin an instance to a specific CPU use "none".
#
# CPU pinning:
# You should always leave one CPU free for normal systme processes, barnyard2, and your rule management
# tools. So for a system with 4 CPUs and dedicated to running Snort, you should only use 3 pinned 
# instances of Snort.
# If your system is also running other services such as Apache, MySQL, Snorby, etc, you should leave 
# additional CPUs free to service requests for these services or not use CPU pinning at all.
#
# Example 1:
# The snort_config line for a passive instance of Snort listening on eth1, started by 
# /etc/init.d/snort.0, with a instance name of "DMZ" and no CPU pinning would be:
#
# config_snort0=( "DMZ" "snort.conf" "eth1" "none" )
#
# And the Snort configuration files would be located in /etc/snort/DMZ/.
#
# Example 2:
# The snort_config line for an inline instance of Snort using eth1 and eth2 started by
# /etc/init.d/snort.9, with an instance name of "Internet" and pinned to processor 4
# would be:
#
# config_snort9=( "Internet" "snort.conf" "eth1:eth2" "4" )
#
# And the Snort configuration files would be located in /etc/snort/Internet/.
