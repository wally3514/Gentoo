		httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and
		logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but
		to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run
		in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon
		process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight
		and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to
		different applications.
