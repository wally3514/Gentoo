This is my development repository for ebuilds I work on or maintain for various
Snort (http://www.snort.org) related projects for the Gentoo Linux distrobution 
(http://www.gentoo.org). The end goal of each project is to have it included in 
the main portage tree, but many of these projects will start in the 
Gentoo Sunrise overlay (http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise) before being 
added to the main tree.

You are welcome to use this repository for your own local overlay, but keep in
mind this is a development space so YMMV.

- If you would like to help out with any of these ebuilds, feel free to contact 
  me. If you have ideas or sugestions, please open an issue on this project's 
  GitHub site. 

- If you find a bug in one of the ebuilds hosted in this repository you can open 
  an issue and I will look at it. 
- If you find a bug in an ebuild that is in the Gentoo portage tree please open 
  a bug at Gentoo's bugzilla site (http://bugs.gentoo.org/) and not here. 
- If you find a bug in an ebuild hosted here and located in the Sunrise Overlay 
  you can fix it your self (that is the point of the Sunrise Overlay) or you can 
  send me an email and I'll look at it when I get a chance.

Below is listed the current location of the non-development versions of the 
ebuilds being worked on here. If you are intrested in these packages and 
prefer to follow the "stable" version in poratge or the Sunrise Overlay those
versions can be found at:
