# The pcap files can be rolled over based on size, time or both.
# If you want to use only size or time, then comment out the one you do not 
# wish to use. If you use both, then the first boundry the file reaches
# will cause the pcap file to roll over.
#
# Rollover the log file if it reaches this size in bytes.
